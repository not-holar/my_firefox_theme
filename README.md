# Installation

## Firefox

> **Recommended**: install the Tree Style Tabs extension first before you do this as the theme will hide the tab bar.

1. Copy the files from [firefox/chrome](firefox/chrome) into the ```chrome``` folder (doesn't exist by default) in your Firefox profile directory. To find your profile directory, go to about:support.  
*Alternatively*: Download using Github Desktop and symlink from the project/chrome folder to your profile/chrome folder, this will make updating the theme as easy as just pressing "Pull origin"
2. Go to about:config, agree that you are responsible for everything horrible you are going to do next.
3. Set ```toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets``` to ```true```.
4. Set ```svg.context-properties.content.enabled``` to ```true```.
5. In the **Customize...** menu, set density to Normal.
6. Download and install [Google Sans](https://www.google.com/search?q=Google+Sans), [Open Sans](https://www.google.com/search?q=Open+Sans) or [Noto Sans](https://www.google.com/search?q=Noto+Sans). Alternatively, remove these two rules: [in userChrome](https://github.com/not-holar/my_firefox_theme/blob/7a2d0e4ec371a283d10a42515422af001ba5b18d/firefox/chrome/userChrome.css#L1-L5), [in userContent](https://github.com/not-holar/my_firefox_theme/blob/7a2d0e4ec371a283d10a42515422af001ba5b18d/firefox/chrome/userContent.css#L7-L9).
